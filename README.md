# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-ML-Project

## Project Description:
In today's dynamic business landscape, understanding and adapting to changing customer sentiments is crucial for sustained success. This project aims to harness the power of sentiment analysis using Twitter to gather valuable insights for airlines. By tracking customer sentiment during various scenarios, such as new product launches or pricing adjustments, airlines can enhance their products, services, and customer support strategies.

Twitter's nature as a platform for quick and frequent communication makes it an ideal source to gauge customer sentiment. This project will focus on employing sentiment analysis techniques to monitor and analyze tweets related to different airlines. By identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, we can uncover what customers appreciate or dislike about each airline's offerings.

The primary focus of this project will be to analyze sentiment related to various airlines, drawing insights from the Twitter data to drive actionable strategies. By harnessing the power of sentiment analysis, this project will provide airlines with a powerful tool to enhance customer satisfaction, refine products and services, and establish more effective customer support mechanisms.
