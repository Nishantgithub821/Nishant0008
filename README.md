# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-ML-Project

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts passenger satisfaction based on various features and attributes related to airline services. We will explore, preprocess, visualize, and analyze the dataset before training and evaluating multiple machine learning models. This project is a practical demonstration of applying data science and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem in the airline industry.

## Dataset
We will be using the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset, which contains information about various factors influencing passenger satisfaction, such as flight distance, inflight entertainment, onboard service, and more. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is located in the data directory.
